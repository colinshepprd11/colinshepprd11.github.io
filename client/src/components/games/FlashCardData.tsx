        front: "What is eventual consistency",
        back: "Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems where updates to a shared state are propagated to all nodes eventually This model does not guarantee immediate consistency but assures that if no new updates are made all nodes will eventually reach the same state It is often used in large-scale systems like Dynamo and Cassandra to provide high availability and partition tolerance",
      },
      {
        front: "Role of consensus algorithms in distributed systems",
        back: "Consensus algorithms ensure that multiple nodes in a distributed system agree on a single data value or state change They are crucial for maintaining consistency replication and fault tolerance Popular algorithms include Paxos Raft and Byzantine Fault Tolerance each offering different trade-offs in terms of performance and complexity",
