It helps in identifying data anomalies, inconsistencies, and patterns that need to be addressed to improve data quality. Profiling aids in the detection of missing data, redundant data, and structural issues, ultimately enabling better data cleaning, transformation, and integration efforts. The insights gained from data profiling are essential for devising targeted data quality improvement strategies and ensuring data meets predefined quality standards.",
